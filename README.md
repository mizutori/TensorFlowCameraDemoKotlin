# TensorFlowCameraDemoKotlin
This project is the Kotlin rewrite of the tensor flow lite camera demo sample code available here.  
https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tensorflow-for-poets-2/tree/master/android/tflite  
  
The best way to learn tensor flow is to start from "TensorFlow for poets" series of codelabs available in the link below.
https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/  
  
After finishing the first session, if you want to go further to learn how to run the tesnor flow model on an Android device,  
there is a very good tutorial - "TensorFlow for poets 2: TFLite Android".  
https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets-2-tflite/#0  
  
The tutorial is very well writtend, and so doe the sample Android app project. 
  
The sample is written in Android, and I thought it's nice to have it in Kotlin.
  
I spent a couple of days and rewrote the code in Kotlin as well as replacing all the deprecated classes and methods with newer ones.
